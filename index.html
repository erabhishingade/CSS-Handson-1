            <li>CSS is Cascading Style Sheets</li>
            <li>
              Css describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or
              in other media.

             <span class="lt">Css is not neccasary</span>  <span class="bg"> CSS saves lot of work.</span> <span>It can control the layout of
                multiple web pages all at once</span> 
            </li>
            <li id="lyt">External stylesheets are stored in css files</li>

    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2> 

    <div class="con2">
      <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>
          External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.
        </li>
        <li>
          The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external Css
          files. However <span class="bg">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> 
          because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it
          yourself.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
    </div>
    

    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.Id is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it'sused by Javascipt.</p>

    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>

    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
